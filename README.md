# Collaboration policy 
* This lab must be completed individually


# Academic Honesty 
* All work submitted for this lab should be your own. Do not use code posted on the internet. If you are using any hints from a previous offering of this course that was posted publicly by a CS24 instructor, you must cite your source.

* You must use the starter code provided for the lab on the release date 2023-01-26. Do not use ANY code from previous offerings of this code. Similarity with old versions of this assignment, including can be used as the basis for academic dishonesty.

# Goals of this lab

The goal of this programming assignment is to practice reading and storing data from input files. There are other extra credit opportunities for this particular assignment, which involve plotting using matplotlibcpp, and some other algorithmic operations such as filtering and smoothing. The only required portion of this programming assignment is reading and storing the data. 

We request that you DO NOT ask the staff to debug your code for you. They have been specifically instructed not to debug *for* you, but rather to *guide you* through the process of debugging your code yourselves.

# Instructions

## Step 1: Getting Ready

1. Go to github and find a repo for this lab assigned to your GitHub id.
2. Log on to your CSIL account.
3. Change into your `~/cs24` directory
4. Clone your empty lab02 repo into your `~/cs24` directory.
5. In your empty repo, do `git checkout -b main` to establish that you are on the `main` branch as your default branch.

## Step 2: Obtain the starter code

The starter code is in this repo:

* *insert starter code link here*

Previous labs contain instruction for the process of:
* Adding a `starter` remote for this repo
* Pulling the code from that `starter` remote into your own repo.

Please do those steps now, and then do a `git push origin main` to populate your own repo with the starter code.

If you need help with these steps:
* First consult previous labs for more detailed instructions.   
* Then, if you are still having trouble, ask the staff for help during discussion section or office hours.

Once you've populated your repo, typing the `ls` command should show you the following files in your current directory

```
% ls
2008CompilationData.csv    dataManipulationFuncs.h  graphs    matplotlibcpp.h
dataManipulationFuncs.cpp  graphingTool.cpp         Makefile
```

## Step 3: Implement the functions

### Assignment Background
This programming assignment investigates oceanic carbon and oxygen isotope ratios over time. These ratios are important since they can help us identify moments of significant temperature change. For example:
-  $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O: oxygen-18 / oxygen-16
-  $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C: carbon-13 / carbon-12

Larger values for $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O indicate lower temperatures

Smaller values for $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C indicate higher temperatures.

### Step 3a: CSV Parsing

*Step 3a is required for full credit on this programming assignment. All other steps are optional and will count as extra credit.*
You will find that all the data is given in csv (comma separated values) format, in three main data types. 

- First Column: time (Ma - Millions of Years Ago)
- Second Column: $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O
- Third Column: $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C

Your Task:

When working with large amounts of data, it is often useful to store it in a data structure such as a vector. 

In ```dataManipulationFuncs.cpp``` there is a function with the declaration:
``` vector<vector<double>> parseData(const string pathToFile, size_t numCol); ```

Your job is to implement this function by parsing the csv data into a ```vector<vector<double>>```

It takes in two arguments:
- ```const string pathToFile```: the relative file location of the csv data.
- ```size_t numCol```: The number of columns stored by the data. 

It outputs:
- ```vector<vector<double>>```: This structure which is returned should be a vector of all the columns, where each column is also represented as a vector. 

Notice there are some data entries that are missing for some rows. When parsing the data, if a row is missing data from any column, do not include it in the final data structure. 

Finally, your function should also check for errors with the file opening process. 

### Step 3b: Plotting

This step involves getting experience with matplotlib for c++, which is a useful library to produce plots of data. 

Inside ```graphingTool.cpp``` you will find a function with the following declaration:
```void scatterPlot(
    const vector<double>& x, 
    const vector<double>& y, 
    const string xlabel, 
    const string ylabel, 
    const string title, 
    const string color);
```

Your job is to implement this function to correctly produce a scatter plot using any arguments that may be passed in. Here is a more detailed explanation of each parameter:
- const vector<double>& x: data point values for a independent variable.
- const vector<double>& y: data point values for a dependent variable.
- const string xlabel: label for the x-axis.
- const string ylabel: label for the y-axis.
- const string title: title for the given plot.
- const string color: color of each point on the scatter plot. (i.e. "blue" or "red")

Your implementation should save the resultant image into a folder called "graphs" in the format: {title}.png

For more information on using the matplotlibcpp library, reference the following documentation: https://matplotlib-cpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs.html#plot-commands

### Step 3c: Filtering

In the real world, sometimes we only care about specific data points with specific qualities.
For example, in the case of this programming assignment, perhaps we would only like to analyze $\delta$<sup>18</sup>O and $\delta$<sup>13</sup>C in a given time period. 

In ```dataManipulationFuncs.cpp``` there is a function with the following declaration:

```
vector<vector<double>> filterData(vector<vector<double>>& rawData, int minAge, int maxAge);
```

```filterData``` should take in the data stored from the parsed csv and return a new ```vector<vector<double>>``` with data points that lie between minAge (inclusive) and maxAge (inclusive). Your implementation should not alter the original data in any way, but should instead return a brand new structure. 

Your job in this step is to implement ```filterData```. 

### Step 3d: Smoothing

Varying results in the data may result in abrupt spikes or dips. Sometimes we want to find general trends in the data by "smoothing" out the curve. 

One good way to smooth out the curve is to make each data point an average of those around it given a certain "window" length. "Window" in this case means a sequential grouping of data points within a certain length. 

For example, suppose we have a vector of 5 numbers: ```4 2 54 1 23```. And we will be looking for the smoothed data with window length of 3.

First, we place the window starting at index 0, ```4 2 54``` will be inside the window. We can calculate the moving average for index 0 is (4 + 2 + 54)/3 = 20

Secondly, we move the window one unit to the right. ```2 54 1``` will be inside the window. The moving average for index 1 is (2 + 54 + 1)/3 = 19.

By doing the previous step recursively, we can finally get our smoothed vector: ```20 19 26 12 23```.

In ```dataManipulationFuncs.cppp``` there is a function with the declaration:

```
vector<vector<double>> smoothData(vector<vector<double>>& rawData, size_t windowSize);
```

You will also notice a helper function in the same file called ```getAvgNextValues```. This function should be called in smoothData to find the values of the new data points. Note, just like in ```filterData```, you should *not* alter the data in the original argument, but instead create and populate a new vector structure. 

## Finishing the Assignment

Now that you've finished the other steps (at least step 3a), you should locate the main function within ```graphingTool.cpp``` and test out your functions! When you feel like you are ready, submit the assignment to gradescope. 
    
## An important word about academic honesty and the gradescope system

We will test your code against other data files too&mdash;not just these.  So while you might be able to pass the tests on gradescope now by just doing a hard-coded "cout" of the expected output, that will NOT receive credit.    

To be very clear, code like this will pass on gradescope, BUT REPRESENTS A FORM OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY since it is an attempt to just "game the system", i.e. to get the tests to pass without really solving the problem.

I would hope this would be obvious, but I have to say it so that there is no ambiguity: hard coding your output is a form of cheating, i.e. a form of "academic dishonesty".  Submitting a program of this kind would be subject not only to a reduced grade, but to possible disciplinary penalties. If there is <em>any</em> doubt about this fact, please ask your TA and/or your instructor for clarification.
