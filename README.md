# Goals for this lab

The goal of this lab is practice *insert learning goals*.  

We request that you DO NOT ask the staff to debug your code for you. They have been specifically instructed not to debug *for* you, but rather to *guide you* through the process of debugging your code yourselves.

# Instructions

## Step 1: Getting Ready

1. Go to github and find a repo for this lab assigned to your GitHub id.
2. Log on to your CSIL account.
3. Change into your `~/cs16` directory
4. Clone your empty lab09 repo into your `~/cs16` directory.
5. In your empty repo, do `git checkout -b main` to establish that you are on the `main` branch as your default branch.

## Step 2: Obtain the starter code

The starter code is in this repo:

* <insert starter code link here>

The URL for cloning this repo is this: `git@github.com:{{site.github_org}}/STARTER-{{page.num}}.git`

Previous labs contain instruction for the process of:
* Adding a `starter` remote for this repo
* Pulling the code from that `starter` remote into your own repo.

Please do those steps now, and then do a `git push origin main` to populate your own repo with the starter code.

If you need help with these steps:
* First consult previous labs for more detailed instructions.   
* Then, if you are still having trouble, ask the staff for help during discussion section or office hours.

Once you've populated your repo, typing the `ls` command should show you the following files in your current directory

```
insert ls result
```

## Step 3: Implement the functions

### Step 3a: CSV Parsing

### Step 3b: Plotting

### Step 3c: Filtering

### Step 3d: Smoothing
